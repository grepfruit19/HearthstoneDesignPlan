# HearthstoneDesignPlan

An imagination of an object oriented structure for the game Hearthstone. I enjoy thinking about how some programs might be structured, and decided to tackle Hearthstone because I've spent a lot of time thinking about a potential structure while playing.

This project was practice utilizing design patterns such as delegation and the command pattern, when to use inheritance and abstract classes over interfaces, and using the single responsibility principle. Implementations are kept minimal in favor of focus on structure.
