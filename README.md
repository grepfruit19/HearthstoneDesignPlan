# HearthstoneDesignPlan

This is a for-fun project I'm doing to imagine an object oriented structure
for the game Hearthstone. I enjoy thinking about how some programs might be structured, and decided to tackle Hearthstone because I've spent a lot of time thinking about a potential structure while playing.

I'm sure that many of the design concepts I use will be naive or not thought out well, and the implementations I'll be creating will be skeletal at best (any implementations be bare bones). This is mostly just a pet project as an exercise to think more about object oriented design.

I find it unlikely that this project will ever get to a state where it compiles. If you're reading this Future Will, let me know how it goes.
