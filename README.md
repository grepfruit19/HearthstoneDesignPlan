# HearthstoneDesignPlan

Project I'm doing to imagine an object oriented structure for the game Hearthstone. I enjoy thinking about how some programs might be structured, and decided to tackle Hearthstone because I've spent a lot of time thinking about a potential structure while playing.

This is mostly just a pet project as an exercise to think more about object oriented design, it's not meant to compile, and God help me if I ever decide to make it compile because that will be terrifying.
