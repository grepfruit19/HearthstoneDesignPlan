# HearthstoneDesignPlan

This is a for-fun project I'm doing to imagine an object oriented structure
for the game Hearthstone. I enjoy thinking about how some programs might be structured, and decided to tackle Hearthstone because I've spent a lot of time thinking about a potential structure while playing.

I don't imagine that this will be "well designed" by any means, and I'm sure it will be riddled with issues small and large, but like I said, this is just a for-fun project.
